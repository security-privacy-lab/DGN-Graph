# Fast and Accurate Anomaly Detection in Dynamic Graphs with a Two-Pronged Approach

AnomRank is an online algorithm for anomaly detection in dynamic graphs. 
AnomRank uses a two-pronged approach defining two novel metrics for anomalousness.
Each metric tracks the derivatives of its own version of a ‘node score’ (or node importance) function.
This allows us to detect sudden changes in the importance of any node. 

Details of AnomRank can be found in our original paper (https://minjiyoon.xyz/Paper/ANRank.pdf)
